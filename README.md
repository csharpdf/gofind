# gofind
a tiny little package manager i made for fun, W.I.P

compiled between 1.17.1 Golang Compiler and Replit 1.14 Golang Compiler

this is just a fork of my other account's repo, this is the only one that will be updated.

# Usage

This package manager can be used in the following ways:

`gof [github repo url]`

This downloads the repo, unpacks it into a folder, and places the folder in the current working directory.
